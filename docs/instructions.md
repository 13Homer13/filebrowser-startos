# Usage Instructions

1. Copy/paste your File Browser Tor address into any Tor-enabled browser.
2. Insert your default username and password. These are located in `Properties`.
3. Bookmark the site for future visits, or better yet, save it to your Bitwarden server!
4. Optionally change your default username/password. Please note, this change **will not** be reflected in the `Properties` section mentioned above.

## Warning

_If you update your username, you will be permanently locked out of your File Browser server if you forget the username or password. We recommend not changing the admin username._
