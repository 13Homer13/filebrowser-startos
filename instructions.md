# Usage Instructions

1. To use File Browser, simply click the `LAUNCH UI`.
2. Insert your default username and password. These are located in `Properties`.
3. Bookmark the site for future visits, or better yet, save it to your Vaultwarden server!
4. Optionally change your default username/password. Please note, this change **will not** be reflected in the `Properties` section mentioned above.
5. If you accidentally lock yourself out, the `"Reset Root User"` action will reset your username and password.

**Note**: The default user session timeout for File Browser is 2 hours. If you're transferring a large number of files and require more time, you can extend this duration up to 24 hours in the service configuration.
